          ### Go to Market Installer

          This tool will walk you through setting up the go-to-market portal. The end result will be Kubernetes manifests that you can use to deploy the Go To Market portal to your infrastructure.

        id: operation

          ### Operation

          When a new customer requests a trial, this tool will

          - Create a new customer record in Replicated
          - Download the license from Replicated and deliver it to the user via browser download
          - Deliver webhooks to update any configured CRM systems with the user's provided info
          - Display configured installation instructions to the user

          [![ops](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/enterprise-gtm-starter/master/doc/operation.png)](https://github.com/replicatedhq/enterprise-gtm-starter/blob/master/doc/operation.png)

    - message:

          ### Configuring

          To get started, you'll need to supply some information about your Replicated App as well as some custom messaging and copy for the portal.

          [![setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/enterprise-gtm-starter/master/doc/setup.png)](https://github.com/replicatedhq/enterprise-gtm-starter/blob/master/doc/setup.png)

          Then you can deploy the portal to your infrastructure.

          Kubernetes manifests have been rendered at `rendered.yaml`.

          If you have `kubectl` configured locally, you can deploy to your cluster with

              kubectl apply -f rendered.yaml
